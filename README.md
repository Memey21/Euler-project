This repository contains the code I have used to solve different questions on the Project Euler website. Project Euler hosts many interesting mathematical problem-solving questions which are intended to be solved using programming. Working on these both improves my mathematical ability to problem solve and also my efficientcy at programming and is a very worthwhile project to pursue.
